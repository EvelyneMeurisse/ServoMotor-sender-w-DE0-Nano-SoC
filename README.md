# ServoMotor-sender-w-DE0-Nano-SoC

Group members : MEURISSE Evelyne, DELPIRE Boris & FACCHIN Florian

This project was realized as part of our course of Hardware/software Platforms of the master in Electrical Engineering at the Polytechnic Faculty of Mons. 

This repository contains all our personnal documents, a tutorial of our project as well as a README file to offer everyone the opportunity to understand our work and to reproduce by itself this.

The purpose of our Project is to send information to a ServoMoter using the DE0-Nano-SoC development kit. 
The useful information that we will send to the servomotor is the counter and the freqeuncy reader. This elements are details in the document "ServoMotor : Theoritical Backgrounds". This document offer the possibility to understand how a servomotor works. 

The Tuto that you can find in this repertory is divided into 2 parts : the Hardware and th Software
