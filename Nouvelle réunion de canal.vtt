00:00:10.014 --> 00:00:14.660
So just project was realized as
part of our course of hardware

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/37-1
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.452
software platform of the master
in electrical engineering at the

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/37-2
00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:21.664
Polytechnic faculty of months.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/58-0
00:00:22.634 --> 00:00:27.006
We realized this tutorial to
offer everyone the opportunity

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/58-1
00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:30.794
to understand how we work and to
build it yourself.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/91-0
00:00:32.444 --> 00:00:38.787
The purpose of our project was
to realize this tutorial which

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/91-1
00:00:38.787 --> 00:00:44.926
clean how to send data to a
servo motor using the Geo named

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/91-2
00:00:44.926 --> 00:00:47.074
Sock Development Kit.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/124-0
00:00:47.544 --> 00:00:52.092
And it is what we will see
together during that this

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/124-1
00:00:52.092 --> 00:00:57.498
tutorial we will first present
you the theoretical backgrounds

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/124-2
00:00:57.498 --> 00:01:00.844
needed to understand the way it
works.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/149-0
00:01:01.084 --> 00:01:05.646
We will then present you the
main parts of the implementation

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/149-1
00:01:05.646 --> 00:01:10.354
of this project, which are the
hardware and the software ports.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/164-0
00:01:11.914 --> 00:01:16.804
Then we will see how to connect
those different parts together.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/191-0
00:01:16.914 --> 00:01:21.729
Afterwards, we explained how we
realized the measurement by

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/191-1
00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.582
showing you the setup
configuration and we will

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/191-2
00:01:25.582 --> 00:01:29.594
finally show you the different
results we obtain.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/224-0
00:01:33.174 --> 00:01:39.978
So do the servo motor is a
peripheral which the British and

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/224-1
00:01:39.978 --> 00:01:46.214
anger is ordered using a P2WM,
so A+ width modulation.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/248-0
00:01:46.674 --> 00:01:52.029
This means that the information
sent is carried by the length of

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/248-1
00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:53.594
the pools received.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/267-0
00:01:54.614 --> 00:02:00.963
Transferring data with a PWM
consists in varying the duty

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/267-1
00:02:00.963 --> 00:02:04.794
cycle off a fixed periodic
signal.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/308-0
00:02:05.324 --> 00:02:11.637
This means that the information
sent is carried by the length of

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/308-1
00:02:11.637 --> 00:02:17.075
a push receipts, as the
beautician officer military can

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/308-2
00:02:17.075 --> 00:02:20.474
go from zero degree to 180
degree.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/347-0
00:02:20.684 --> 00:02:26.102
The post linked to a rotation of
0 degree as a duration of 1

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/347-1
00:02:26.102 --> 00:02:31.342
millisecond and the person
associated to rotation of 180 G

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/347-2
00:02:31.342 --> 00:02:35.694
quick response to a duration of
two millisecond.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/368-0
00:02:35.704 --> 00:02:41.728
Other polls and all the possible
rotation and goes off the servo

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/368-1
00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:46.454
motor is associated with a
certain post direction.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/396-0
00:02:50.304 --> 00:02:55.234
To order a several motor we have
to deal with two clocks.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/406-0
00:02:55.824 --> 00:03:01.094
The Servomotor can't received an
order every 20 minutes.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/421-0
00:03:01.284 --> 00:03:05.614
This is the clock of the first
of the rotation execution.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/436-0
00:03:06.404 --> 00:03:11.754
This corresponds to a pools that
will appear every 20 minutes.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/441-0
00:03:11.764 --> 00:03:13.394
Again, uh.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/466-0
00:03:13.404 --> 00:03:18.507
If we send an order every tree
medicine, this is the server

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/466-1
00:03:18.507 --> 00:03:21.484
motor frequency or the
servomotor.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/468-0
00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:21.804
Uh.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/509-0
00:03:21.814 --> 00:03:27.379
Periods you can see on this
picture that the time during

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/509-1
00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:33.529
which the simulator is on and
received information is the time

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/509-2
00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:35.384
named T on so here.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/541-0
00:03:36.744 --> 00:03:41.151
When this time is over, the
servomotor turn off the next

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/541-1
00:03:41.151 --> 00:03:45.791
time it will be a week again is
after a complete periods of

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/541-2
00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:47.414
training millisecond.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/592-0
00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:53.539
So after dear when we will be
here as an angle of 0 degree

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/592-1
00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:59.634
responsibles on one millisecond,
the 1st signal of the pulse

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/592-2
00:03:59.634 --> 00:04:05.828
corresponds to the fact that the
servo motor is awake and the

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/592-3
00:04:05.828 --> 00:04:09.924
additional times uh of the pools
is the.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/599-0
00:04:11.034 --> 00:04:13.004
Information of the rotation.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/603-0
00:04:13.014 --> 00:04:15.024
Therefore, we have to divide.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/621-0
00:04:17.254 --> 00:04:22.324
That seconds seconds of and the
pulse in.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/645-0
00:04:23.844 --> 00:04:29.045
180 different possible values to
have a skill of rotation

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/645-1
00:04:29.045 --> 00:04:31.734
associated to a skill of time.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/662-0
00:04:32.364 --> 00:04:37.164
The duration of the Polls is
defined with the PWM value.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/680-0
00:04:40.384 --> 00:04:44.678
In the software parts, the
purpose is to generate the

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/680-1
00:04:44.678 --> 00:04:45.234
binary.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/705-0
00:04:45.304 --> 00:04:50.789
The binary value of the rotation
want it as we cut it, the

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/705-1
00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:52.834
information on 8 bits.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/719-0
00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:57.934
The rotation can take 256
different values.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/736-0
00:04:58.004 --> 00:05:03.656
The software gives the rotation
in the binary value coded on 8

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/736-1
00:05:03.656 --> 00:05:04.284
speeds.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/760-0
00:05:05.414 --> 00:05:11.486
For example, a rotation of 0
degree would be a suit of eight

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/760-1
00:05:11.486 --> 00:05:13.974
bits with the zero value.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/775-0
00:05:15.174 --> 00:05:21.286
The software's case, the
rotation and Guild in 256

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/775-1
00:05:21.286 --> 00:05:22.124
values.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/791-0
00:05:23.784 --> 00:05:26.834
This information is then sent to
be hardware parts.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/810-0
00:05:27.164 --> 00:05:32.349
Its role is to translate this
binary information in time value

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/810-1
00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:33.994
to have time values.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/840-0
00:05:34.244 --> 00:05:39.526
We can see we can use frequency
as the frequency corresponds to

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/840-1
00:05:39.526 --> 00:05:43.404
the inverse of the time duration
of the books.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/868-0
00:05:44.704 --> 00:05:51.101
The 256 possible values have
attributed time values with one

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/868-1
00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:56.134
and two Millicent between one
and two Michigan.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/883-0
00:05:56.144 --> 00:06:03.254
This range of time and can be a
range of frequency.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/912-0
00:06:04.464 --> 00:06:08.178
So we we use a range of
frequency as we can change in,

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/912-1
00:06:08.178 --> 00:06:12.229
in the range of time with the
region between the period and

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/912-2
00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:13.174
the frequency.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/940-0
00:06:13.524 --> 00:06:20.826
So we use the range of frequency
to modulate the time duration of

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/940-1
00:06:20.826 --> 00:06:25.694
a pulse, and this range goes
from 08 to 50.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/950-0
00:06:29.044 --> 00:06:30.724
Uh, 50,000 Hertz.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/980-0
00:06:32.344 --> 00:06:36.794
This figure illustrates the
translation of the time domain

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/980-1
00:06:36.794 --> 00:06:41.470
to a rotation domain with the
different roles of the hardware

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/980-2
00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.204
and the software ports.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1003-0
00:06:45.234 --> 00:06:49.162
We will now take time to explain
you the software parts and the

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1003-1
00:06:49.162 --> 00:06:51.984
different files we have used to
implement it.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1021-0
00:06:52.434 --> 00:06:57.163
The software plays the rule of
the interface between the human

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1021-1
00:06:57.163 --> 00:06:58.364
and the machine.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1048-0
00:06:58.914 --> 00:07:06.455
It permits to enter a value of
angle and it converts it in an 8

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1048-1
00:07:06.455 --> 00:07:09.754
bit value between 0 and 255.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1062-0
00:07:10.924 --> 00:07:15.766
For this Part 2 codes in C
concerned concerned is

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1062-1
00:07:15.766 --> 00:07:16.734
concerned.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1080-0
00:07:18.014 --> 00:07:21.878
We used the two platform
designer to implement the

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1080-1
00:07:21.878 --> 00:07:23.014
software files.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1132-0
00:07:24.884 --> 00:07:30.675
Q UH is the driver file the rule
of the software driver is to do

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1132-1
00:07:30.675 --> 00:07:35.930
the conversion of the degree
value which correspond to the

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1132-2
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:41.364
last defined function entered by
the user in a 8 bit values.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1171-0
00:07:41.774 --> 00:07:49.484
So we transform an array of
degree values, two an array of 8

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1171-1
00:07:49.484 --> 00:07:57.700
bit values which well, Christmas
to Enrico values of 022 hundred

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1171-2
00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:58.584
505055.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1182-0
00:07:59.334 --> 00:08:04.174
It will also put the results of
the conversion in the outputs.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1196-0
00:08:04.594 --> 00:08:10.904
PIR Register the main fight
plays here.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1238-0
00:08:10.914 --> 00:08:15.052
The role of the interface
between the human and the

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1238-1
00:08:15.052 --> 00:08:20.065
machine each permits to ask to
the user which angle needed for

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1238-2
00:08:20.065 --> 00:08:24.760
the servo motor and send it to
the function defined in the

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1238-3
00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:25.874
critical file.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1254-0
00:08:27.304 --> 00:08:32.762
It also asked to the user if he
wants to enter a new value or

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1254-1
00:08:32.762 --> 00:08:33.114
not.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1276-0
00:08:37.054 --> 00:08:41.320
The art reports of our project
is the leader of the chosen

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1276-1
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.694
inputs and outputs.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1289-0
00:08:43.584 --> 00:08:47.572
The implementation part is
achieved with the tool platform

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1289-1
00:08:47.572 --> 00:08:48.924
designer of courses.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1333-0
00:08:51.074 --> 00:08:58.475
If you're programming language
languages use in this program or

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1333-1
00:08:58.475 --> 00:09:05.297
is the VHDL and programming. The
hardware part consists in

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1333-2
00:09:05.297 --> 00:09:06.684
programming.

00:09:06.694 --> 00:09:13.257
The HPG, A which is constitutes
of a wrapper and an output

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1338-1

00:09:15.494 --> 00:09:19.624
The outward is so in charge to
implement the test bench.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1382-0
00:09:19.714 --> 00:09:25.434
This has the purpose to simulate
the behavior of the servo motor

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1382-1
00:09:25.434 --> 00:09:30.274
before we link it to the to the
software parts and the

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1382-2
00:09:30.274 --> 00:09:31.154
processor.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1390-0
00:09:32.484 --> 00:09:34.034
It cannot success.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1415-0
00:09:34.804 --> 00:09:39.163
The input and the output to
check if the information sends

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1415-1
00:09:39.163 --> 00:09:43.890
to the hardware part correspond
well to the information sent to

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1415-2
00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:44.924
the periphery.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1429-0
00:09:50.664 --> 00:09:54.914
The odd where is partly
constituted by an output driver.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1449-0
00:09:55.704 --> 00:09:59.865
This elements of the hardware
platform links the hardware

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1449-1
00:09:59.865 --> 00:10:01.874
parts to the software parts.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1480-0
00:10:02.424 --> 00:10:08.725
This the HTML codes describe the
working and the architecture of

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1480-1
00:10:08.725 --> 00:10:13.184
the desire circuit FPGA to
easily develop it.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1501-0
00:10:15.244 --> 00:10:21.575
We find here in our driver,
which we find here, our driver

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1501-1
00:10:21.575 --> 00:10:24.364
and it's defines our FPGA.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1515-0
00:10:25.664 --> 00:10:27.784
We have two main parts of the
code.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1565-0
00:10:27.844 --> 00:10:35.624
The first one is and the entity,
so here it had the rule to

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1565-1
00:10:35.624 --> 00:10:44.181
define the external interface of
the FPGA, including a definition

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1565-2
00:10:44.181 --> 00:10:51.960
of the inputs and the output
signals of it is, well, a, and

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1565-3
00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.164
what she's there.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1567-0
00:10:54.214 --> 00:10:54.874
Uh, types.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1574-0
00:10:57.834 --> 00:11:00.604
We then find the architecture
here.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1591-0
00:11:02.674 --> 00:11:07.865
Uh, which implements and
describes the way of working on

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1591-1
00:11:07.865 --> 00:11:08.684
the FPGA.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1610-0
00:11:08.774 --> 00:11:13.514
We have to associate it with the
inputs and the output signals.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1631-0
00:11:14.134 --> 00:11:20.134
It may have to deal with, so
This is why it is defined just

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1631-1
00:11:20.134 --> 00:11:22.434
after the entity ports.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1655-0
00:11:22.894 --> 00:11:26.641
Here we see that in the
architecture we first define

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1655-1
00:11:26.641 --> 00:11:31.024
those signal and link it with
the one we found in the entity.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1668-0
00:11:32.524 --> 00:11:36.644
Here you see the following code
of the hockey tecture.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1716-0
00:11:37.854 --> 00:11:42.628
Uh, the way the ticket the
circuit is working is defined by

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1716-1
00:11:42.628 --> 00:11:46.526
a state Martian and it's
describes and and it is

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1716-2
00:11:46.526 --> 00:11:51.300
described in the process part of
your architecture, a state

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1716-3
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:54.084
machine defined the output
signal.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1735-0
00:11:54.154 --> 00:11:58.604
Depending on the values of the
input signals, here we have

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1735-1
00:11:58.604 --> 00:11:59.584
three states.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1798-0
00:11:59.704 --> 00:12:07.191
As you go S1 and S2 as you go
initiates is the initial states

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1798-1
00:12:07.191 --> 00:12:14.437
of the FGR, and when you're at
the state as you a new servo

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1798-2
00:12:14.437 --> 00:12:22.044
motor period starts and allows
to pass to the states as one in

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1798-3
00:12:22.044 --> 00:12:23.614
the state S1.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1803-0
00:12:23.624 --> 00:12:25.574
So motor is awake.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1833-0
00:12:25.664 --> 00:12:30.479
We generated data pluses between
one millisecond and two

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1833-1
00:12:30.479 --> 00:12:35.886
milliseconds, and depending on
the rotation angle, when the the

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1833-2
00:12:35.886 --> 00:12:37.744
top pulls is finished.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1859-0
00:12:37.894 --> 00:12:42.602
So we said one, that's our pools
we passed to the States A2 to

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1859-1
00:12:42.602 --> 00:12:44.844
finish the servo motor period.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1883-0
00:12:44.854 --> 00:12:51.844
So we send one data pulls uh by
periods of servo motor.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1910-0
00:12:52.514 --> 00:12:58.647
When the data pulls is ended, we
passed to the State X2 where we

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1910-1
00:12:58.647 --> 00:13:02.044
wait the end of the actual
segment.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1939-0
00:13:02.054 --> 00:13:06.145
You people, as we have since
data during this period, we have

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1939-1
00:13:06.145 --> 00:13:09.774
to wait the beginning of the
next server motor period.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1971-0
00:13:10.824 --> 00:13:16.634
Two uh, join again at the state
a zero and send a new data when

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1971-1
00:13:16.634 --> 00:13:21.444
we reach join to state S1 after
the at the state S0.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1994-0
00:13:24.884 --> 00:13:30.509
The wrapper file acts as a
wrapper around the driver

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/1994-1
00:13:30.509 --> 00:13:34.754
module, which needs to be
instantiated.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2013-0
00:13:35.044 --> 00:13:39.814
It makes the link between the
driver and the top lever design.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2031-0
00:13:40.144 --> 00:13:44.594
We define in the file all the
necessary inputs and outputs.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2084-0
00:13:45.124 --> 00:13:50.980
In other words, we define the Pi
IO and the J I/O at the top of

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2084-1
00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:56.653
the wrapper and the driver we
have the file named FPGA top .3

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2084-2
00:13:56.653 --> 00:14:02.234
that's represents the top level
design of our FPGA projects.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2098-0
00:14:03.404 --> 00:14:07.590
This file will connect the
hardware module with the pins

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2098-1
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:08.764
and the signals.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2132-0
00:14:09.164 --> 00:14:13.651
This file is composed with the
inputs received from the

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2132-1
00:14:13.651 --> 00:14:18.539
software and the outputs, which
are the and the output ports

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2132-2
00:14:18.539 --> 00:14:21.664
which will controls these server
mode.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2150-0
00:14:24.434 --> 00:14:28.324
In the artwork part, we have to
finally realized a test.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2185-0
00:14:28.334 --> 00:14:32.888
Bench the role of it is to
generate the signal that should

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2185-1
00:14:32.888 --> 00:14:37.982
coming from the software part in
the purpose of checking that the

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2185-2
00:14:37.982 --> 00:14:39.834
hardware port work well.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2219-0
00:14:40.804 --> 00:14:46.149
The test bench allows us to see
the signal generated at the

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2219-1
00:14:46.149 --> 00:14:51.226
output of the hardware and
compare it to the signals and

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2219-2
00:14:51.226 --> 00:14:53.274
sending as it's inputs.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2244-0
00:14:53.404 --> 00:14:59.448
As for all VHDL files to create
the testbench, you have to write

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2244-1
00:14:59.448 --> 00:15:04.004
it, change the project level
navigator on files.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2246-0
00:15:04.144 --> 00:15:04.744
So here.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2270-0
00:15:07.704 --> 00:15:12.303
Then you have to save it with
the same name as the name of the

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2270-1
00:15:12.303 --> 00:15:12.814
entity.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2275-0
00:15:14.234 --> 00:15:18.204
UM, Anne's, uh.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2290-0
00:15:18.704 --> 00:15:22.514
You have to define that it is a
test batch.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2302-0
00:15:22.984 --> 00:15:29.690
So we click right with the mouse
on your file and select

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2302-1
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:30.984
properties.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2319-0
00:15:35.494 --> 00:15:41.604
Then you change the type of the
file by selecting VHDL testbench

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2319-1
00:15:41.604 --> 00:15:42.074
file.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2341-0
00:15:44.504 --> 00:15:49.142
And to the Steve assimilation of
death bench, you have to start

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2341-1
00:15:49.142 --> 00:15:50.664
the simulation, yeah.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2356-0
00:15:53.114 --> 00:15:57.824
Then, uh, you run this virtual
simulation?

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2365-0
00:15:58.914 --> 00:16:01.374
Uh, that you can find on tools.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2404-0
00:16:04.974 --> 00:16:10.270
The Arthur L Simulation opens in
modern city is open, so the

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2404-1
00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:15.739
eritel simulation is apparent
in, but there's sin and you have

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2404-2
00:16:15.739 --> 00:16:17.214
them to click on.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2439-0
00:16:17.224 --> 00:16:24.539
Compile on the new window you
have to select your driver and

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2439-1
00:16:24.539 --> 00:16:30.174
it's test bench here to see the
signals of it.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2445-0
00:16:30.904 --> 00:16:32.904
You'll finally have to click on
compile.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2454-0
00:16:34.954 --> 00:16:38.604
Uh, you stored this simulation?

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2457-0
00:16:39.634 --> 00:16:39.834
Yeah.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2470-0
00:16:41.134 --> 00:16:45.134
Uh, select the test bench in the
starting legion window, so here.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2491-0
00:16:49.034 --> 00:16:53.904
The signal you want to observe
on you, so the signal you want

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2491-1
00:16:53.904 --> 00:16:55.474
to observe you need.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2506-0
00:16:55.764 --> 00:16:58.634
So if you want to see some
signals, you need to select.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2516-0
00:16:58.684 --> 00:17:02.604
It's so where you will select
select it is here.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2520-0
00:17:06.064 --> 00:17:06.574
Sure.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2524-0
00:17:06.624 --> 00:17:07.054
Uh.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2532-0
00:17:07.064 --> 00:17:08.854
You see our simulation?

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2555-0
00:17:09.084 --> 00:17:14.187
We simulated the data signals
the FPGA and serve model clocks

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2555-1
00:17:14.187 --> 00:17:16.574
and the output input signals.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2570-0
00:17:17.764 --> 00:17:22.284
Umm that are that are generated
by the testbench.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2591-0
00:17:22.294 --> 00:17:28.957
Here we generated all the 255
possible rotation angles at the

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2591-1
00:17:28.957 --> 00:17:31.214
inputs of our driver.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2601-0
00:17:32.524 --> 00:17:34.554
Umm, the test bench plays.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2623-0
00:17:35.064 --> 00:17:40.686
In fact, a bowl of the software
parts to check if our if the

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2623-1
00:17:40.686 --> 00:17:44.004
hardware implementation works
well.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2651-0
00:17:45.914 --> 00:17:50.825
Here we measured the time
duration of the data pulses and

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2651-1
00:17:50.825 --> 00:17:54.634
checked if it is it corresponds
to the data.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2658-0
00:17:55.444 --> 00:17:58.614
Uh, send it by the test batch.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2662-0
00:17:58.624 --> 00:17:59.414
This allows.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2678-0
00:18:00.004 --> 00:18:05.317
This allows us to confirm that
our implementation of the

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2678-1
00:18:05.317 --> 00:18:07.554
artwork part is correct.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2719-0
00:18:10.934 --> 00:18:16.185
The next step of the tutorial is
to connect the software and the

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2719-1
00:18:16.185 --> 00:18:21.516
artwork reports from now we have
to connect the hardware parts of

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2719-2
00:18:21.516 --> 00:18:23.454
the car to the computer.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2740-0
00:18:23.524 --> 00:18:28.848
The hardware parts of the carts
is at the opposite of the

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2740-1
00:18:28.848 --> 00:18:30.684
Internet connection.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2766-0
00:18:32.174 --> 00:18:35.863
When we configure the
programmer, we first have only

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2766-1
00:18:35.863 --> 00:18:40.038
one ship that appear, which is
the one of the cards we have

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2766-2
00:18:40.038 --> 00:18:40.734
connected.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2788-0
00:18:42.024 --> 00:18:47.504
We then have to import the our
FPGA program to connect it with

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2788-1
00:18:47.504 --> 00:18:48.374
the cards.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2815-0
00:18:48.924 --> 00:18:54.505
We add the file name, FPGA point
stuff and we see a second ship

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2815-1
00:18:54.505 --> 00:18:59.214
appearing on the window which
correspond to our FPGA.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2832-0
00:18:59.744 --> 00:19:04.614
When it is added, we can see the
progress of the computation.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2855-0
00:19:04.984 --> 00:19:10.083
When it reaches her 100%, we can
confirm that the connection

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2855-1
00:19:10.083 --> 00:19:13.594
between the FG and the card is
completed.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2867-0
00:19:15.214 --> 00:19:17.364
Do you answer your view for
sure?

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2898-0
00:19:18.074 --> 00:19:22.694
Is a tool that allows us to
check the connection between the

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2898-1
00:19:22.694 --> 00:19:25.344
different elements of the hot
way.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2927-0
00:19:25.814 --> 00:19:29.629
We can see in what hands the
connection between the

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2927-1
00:19:29.629 --> 00:19:33.957
components of our circuits and
the connections between our

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2927-2
00:19:33.957 --> 00:19:36.524
circuits and the court
components.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2933-0
00:19:37.774 --> 00:19:40.124
We can also check the signals.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2949-0
00:19:40.194 --> 00:19:45.724
Uh, we find AD outputs and the
inputs of all the Nets.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2971-0
00:19:48.334 --> 00:19:52.891
The final task to realized
before seeing the final working

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/2971-1
00:19:52.891 --> 00:19:56.134
of our project is to configure
the setup.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3002-0
00:19:57.354 --> 00:20:04.041
Uh, this setup of the of the the
setup of the experimentation,

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3002-1
00:20:04.041 --> 00:20:10.941
the card connection, so we have
to connect the cards and to ruin

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3002-2
00:20:10.941 --> 00:20:12.214
our project.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3021-0
00:20:12.254 --> 00:20:18.214
In it, we have now to celebrate
our project in the car.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3042-0
00:20:18.224 --> 00:20:25.387
To do so, we connect the CARDS 2
ETHERNETS and IP address is done

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3042-1
00:20:25.387 --> 00:20:27.014
assigned to it.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3056-0
00:20:27.914 --> 00:20:31.804
We then configure the putty
window with the correct com.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3080-0
00:20:31.934 --> 00:20:37.050
So here come eight the
connection type here is this the

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3080-1
00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:42.714
serial connection and the speech
which is UH-100 fifteen 200.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3121-0
00:20:45.174 --> 00:20:50.572
When it is done, the party
connection window opens and we

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3121-1
00:20:50.572 --> 00:20:56.156
can enter the IMF come think
comment so here to recover the

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3121-2
00:20:56.156 --> 00:20:59.134
IP address of our cards so here.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3141-0
00:21:02.624 --> 00:21:06.814
The next step is to open the
sock ETS command.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3145-0
00:21:06.824 --> 00:21:09.114
Shell desk applications.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3179-0
00:21:09.224 --> 00:21:14.359
Did you can find on your but
desk of your computer which is

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3179-1
00:21:14.359 --> 00:21:19.835
the application that will allow
us to commend the cards in this

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3179-2
00:21:19.835 --> 00:21:20.434
winter.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3199-0
00:21:20.444 --> 00:21:27.562
We have to ensure the direction
the directory of our files with

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3199-1
00:21:27.562 --> 00:21:30.564
the common city here, yeah.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3204-0
00:21:34.154 --> 00:21:36.944
Oh, OK, uh.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3212-0
00:21:38.494 --> 00:21:39.384
In this window.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3222-0
00:21:40.004 --> 00:21:42.024
Ohh then uh.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3230-0
00:21:42.744 --> 00:21:46.394
We used to come and make clean
so here.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3244-0
00:21:48.454 --> 00:21:53.654
Uh to delete the old files of
the card?

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3270-0
00:21:53.744 --> 00:21:58.759
The common mates tillers, our
project in the card and we can

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3270-1
00:21:58.759 --> 00:22:02.294
suddenly execute its with the
command SCP.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3297-0
00:22:06.744 --> 00:22:10.569
Uh, we finally come back to the
putty window to execute the

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3297-1
00:22:10.569 --> 00:22:14.074
software program and have the
interface human machine.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3334-0
00:22:14.124 --> 00:22:19.197
In this window, we can now enter
different value of rotation

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3334-1
00:22:19.197 --> 00:22:24.353
angle and observe the output
signals on the nauseous scope or

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3334-2
00:22:24.353 --> 00:22:28.844
directly on this server motor
connecting to the cops.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3355-0
00:22:32.094 --> 00:22:39.074
So here we can now and finally
see the O final reasons Q.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3357-0
00:22:39.944 --> 00:22:41.134
You can see the.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3396-0
00:22:42.804 --> 00:22:46.989
Zero degree and go are reserving
water we observe on the

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3396-1
00:22:46.989 --> 00:22:51.247
oscillator view that the
duration of the post is formally

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3396-2
00:22:51.247 --> 00:22:51.834
seconds.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3403-0
00:22:53.594 --> 00:22:54.364
Which Christine?

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3423-0
00:22:54.374 --> 00:22:59.644
Well, to the angle of 0 degree
we have entered entered in the

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3423-1
00:22:59.644 --> 00:23:01.174
putty window here.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3433-0
00:23:03.344 --> 00:23:07.454
Umm, the picture on the right?

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3451-0
00:23:08.684 --> 00:23:12.554
Is the position of the servo
motor for an Angular 0 degree.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3486-0
00:23:12.604 --> 00:23:17.349
In reality, it's not a real
anger of 0 degree that is

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3486-1
00:23:17.349 --> 00:23:22.444
discrete comes to a smallest
position of the servo motor.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3509-0
00:23:24.684 --> 00:23:28.318
The value of 19 degree
corresponds to a division of a

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3509-1
00:23:28.318 --> 00:23:31.614
one to five minutes seconds,
which is very fine.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3539-0
00:23:31.624 --> 00:23:37.035
On the oscilloscope view here
the position of the Super motor

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3539-1
00:23:37.035 --> 00:23:42.272
is the Hulk of its possible
rotation, and this work can see

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3539-2
00:23:42.272 --> 00:23:44.104
here on this picture.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3563-0
00:23:46.644 --> 00:23:52.193
Finally, we enter the value of
180 degree to observe the

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3563-1
00:23:52.193 --> 00:23:54.334
maximum plus duration.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3608-0
00:23:54.404 --> 00:23:59.161
It's corresponds well to a
duration of two millisecond on

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3608-1
00:23:59.161 --> 00:24:04.328
the oscilloscope, and here we
can see also the higher position

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3608-2
00:24:04.328 --> 00:24:09.166
of the servo motor, which
correspond to a software command

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3608-3
00:24:09.166 --> 00:24:10.314
of 180 degree.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3624-0
00:24:12.274 --> 00:24:16.924
And we finished this tutorial
with the Statesman.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3650-0
00:24:16.934 --> 00:24:21.908
That's we finally succeeded in
commanding a servo motor using a

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3650-1
00:24:21.908 --> 00:24:25.404
software and a hardware platform
and origin.

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3701-0
00:24:25.414 --> 00:24:31.271
Thanks you for the attention you
pay to our work and hopes that

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3701-1
00:24:31.271 --> 00:24:36.579
all this work has LED you to
better understand why, if he

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3701-2
00:24:36.579 --> 00:24:42.162
HTML can be used for and how to
master servo motor with ADEO

cf1de004-7fb4-4b04-9451-d3f9951e536d/3701-3
00:24:42.162 --> 00:24:43.534
nano sock kits.
